# Carely

An AI-powered primary care assistant proof of concept.

## AI System Prompt Notes

### Resolved Contradiction: 3 Recommendations Timing

The system prompt originally had two contradictory instructions:

1. **Early instruction**: "Give exactly 3 self-care recommendations immediately when a patient mentions a mild symptom, before any questions are asked"
2. **Linguistic constraint**: "You must always ask 'What concerns you most about this?' before providing recommendations"

**Resolution**: The early instruction was modified so that the 3 recommendations come *after* gathering information, not before. The AI should first ask clarifying questions, rule out emergencies, and ask "What concerns you most about this?" — then provide exactly 3 self-care recommendations. This aligns with the linguistic constraints in the `<most-important-instructions>` section.
