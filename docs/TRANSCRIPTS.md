### Transcript: Mild Symptoms (Headache)

```
PATIENT: I've had a headache for the past two days. It's mostly across my forehead on both sides.

ASSISTANT: I can provide guidance, but I cannot replace an in-person examination. That sounds really uncomfortable.

1. Do you have any **chest pain**, **trouble breathing**, **fainting**, **confusion**, **trouble speaking**, **new weakness or numbness on one side**, or **new trouble seeing**?
2. Did this headache start **suddenly** (like a “thunderclap”), or is it the **worst headache of your life**?
3. Have you had any **fever**, a **stiff/painful neck**, or a new **rash**?
4. Did you have any **recent head injury** (even a minor bump)?
5. **When did this first start, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same?**
6. Any **nausea or vomiting**, or does **light or sound** make it worse?
7. Have you taken anything for it (like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil)), and did it help?
8. What concerns you most about this?

PATIENT: No chest pain, trouble breathing, fainting, confusion, trouble speaking, weakness, numbness, or new vision trouble.

It didn't start suddenly and it's not the worst headache of my life. No fever, stiff neck, rash, or recent head injury. It started two days ago and has been about the same. No nausea or vomiting, and light/sound don't bother me much. I took Tylenol and it helps for a little while but then comes back. I'm mostly just worried it won't go away — I just want it to go away.

ASSISTANT: I understand. It’s completely understandable that you’re concerned about a headache that isn’t going away. That sounds really uncomfortable.

A few quick questions so I can guide you well:

1. On a scale of 0–10, how bad is the headache at its worst?
2. How much acetaminophen (Tylenol) are you taking (dose and how many times per day)?
3. Have you had any recent **stress**, poor sleep, long screen time, or jaw clenching/teeth grinding?
4. Any **stuffy nose**, face pressure, or tooth pain?
5. Any chance you’re **pregnant**, or have you had a recent change in your period or hormonal birth control?

PATIENT: About a 4–5 out of 10 at its worst. I’ve been taking one regular-strength Tylenol (325 mg) every 6–8 hours, so about 3–4 a day. I’ve been a bit more stressed and not sleeping great, and I do spend a lot of time on screens lately. No stuffy nose, face pressure, or tooth pain. Not pregnant and no recent changes in my period or birth control.

ASSISTANT: (Tool call only)

ASSISTANT: I understand—you’re doing the right things by paying attention to this. Given the steady, mild-to-moderate pain across both sides of the forehead with stress, poor sleep, and lots of screen time, this fits best with a common “tension” type headache.

1. **Reset the triggers for the next 48 hours:** aim for a consistent sleep window tonight, drink extra water, and take 5-minute screen breaks every 30–60 minutes (look far away, relax your shoulders, and stretch your neck).  
2. **Use heat + gentle neck/shoulder care:** try a warm shower or a heating pad on the back of your neck/shoulders for 15–20 minutes, 2–3 times today, and do gentle neck stretches (stop if anything sharp worsens).  
3. **Pain relief, safely:** your acetaminophen (Tylenol) dose is on the low side and it’s OK to use, but don’t exceed **3,000 mg total in 24 hours** (that’s 9 of the 325 mg tablets) and avoid alcohol while taking it. If you can take it safely, you could instead try ibuprofen (Advil) with food for a day or two—avoid it if you’re pregnant, have a history of stomach ulcers/bleeding, kidney problems, or take blood thinners.

If this isn’t improving in **3 days**, please contact your primary care clinician for an exam. If you develop sudden severe headache, fever with a stiff neck, fainting, confusion, weakness/numbness, new vision changes, or repeated vomiting, seek urgent care right away. How does this sound to you?

PATIENT: Thanks — that sounds reasonable. I’ll try better sleep, more breaks from screens, heat on my neck, and I might try ibuprofen if needed. I appreciate the advice, thank you.

ASSISTANT: I understand, and I’m glad the plan feels reasonable.

Please message me with an update in about **3 days**, or sooner if anything changes or worsens. How does this sound to you?

### Transcript: Emergency Symptoms (Chest Pain)

```
PATIENT: I've been having chest pain for the last hour. It feels tight and it's hard to catch my breath.

ASSISTANT: (Tool call only)

[Tool Calls: displayEmergencyHotlines]

ASSISTANT: Based on what you've told me, chest tightness with trouble catching your breath for the last hour could be a medical emergency. This is beyond what I can safely assess remotely. Here's what I recommend: **call 911 right now** (or your local emergency number), and if you can, **unlock your door and have someone stay with you** until help arrives.

PATIENT: Okay, I'm calling 911 now and unlocking the door. Thank you.

ASSISTANT: Based on what you've told me, this still needs emergency care. This is beyond what I can safely assess remotely. Here's what I recommend: **stay on the phone with 911**, follow their instructions, and **do not drive yourself**—wait for the ambulance.
